# Orion AI MT4

This is the code for the Orion AI MT4 Expert Advisor. Orion AI is a powerful forex software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in this product.

## Currency Pairs

The Expert Advisor is designed to trade on the following currency pairs:
- EURUSD
- GBPUSD
- USDJPY
- AUDUSD

## Expert Advisor Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is responsible for initializing the Expert Advisor. In this function, the Orion AI algorithm is initialized by calling the `InitializeOrionAI` function. Additional technical indicators or analysis tools can be added by calling the `AddIndicators` function.

## Expert Advisor Start Function

The `OnTick` function is the start function of the Expert Advisor. It is called on each tick of the price data. In this function, the trade entry criteria are checked using the `CheckEntryCriteria` function. If the criteria are met, buy/sell orders are executed for each currency pair using the `ExecuteOrder` function. Similarly, the trade exit criteria are checked using the `CheckExitCriteria` function. If the criteria are met, all open orders for each currency pair are closed using the `CloseOrders` function.

## Initialization and Indicators

The `InitializeOrionAI` function is responsible for incorporating the new Orion AI algorithm. This is where the code for the algorithm would be implemented.

The `AddIndicators` function is used to add any additional technical indicators or analysis tools. This is where the code for adding indicators or tools would be implemented.

## Trade Entry and Exit Criteria

The `CheckEntryCriteria` function is used to check the trade entry criteria. This is where the code for checking the entry criteria would be implemented. The function should return `true` if the criteria are met.

The `CheckExitCriteria` function is used to check the trade exit criteria. This is where the code for checking the exit criteria would be implemented. The function should return `true` if the criteria are met.

## Order Execution and Closing

The `ExecuteOrder` function is used to execute buy/sell orders for a specific currency pair. This is where the code for executing the orders would be implemented. The function takes a `currencyPair` parameter, which specifies the currency pair for which the order should be executed.

The `CloseOrders` function is used to close all open orders for a specific currency pair. This is where the code for closing the orders would be implemented. The function takes a `currencyPair` parameter, which specifies the currency pair for which the orders should be closed.
